		This was a game I created on a whim in about 3-4 hours after a friend 
		jokingly asked me what would happen if "Flappy Bird" and "2048" were 
		combined together. In my interpretation, the bird becomes a chain of 
		blocks representing the powers of two that combine together like the 
		2048 game. As you play, the chain becomes longer and longer, making it 
		harder to weave between the gaps in the incoming walls, creating a 
		difficulty curve innate in the design of the game.
