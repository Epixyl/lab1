		<h3>Hi! I'm a UCSD CSE Computer Engineering student, and this is 
		my portfolio project for my HCI design class!</h3>

	  <p>

		I love to code - my journey began with a simple drag-and-drop game design
		language back in junior high. My fascination with programming was born in
		that very summer camp. Coming from an environment where the answer to 
		"Can I do that" was usually a resounding "no," I easily saw the possibilities 
		programming provided. Ever since then, I have tinkered with programming 
		everything from computer games to calculator programs to even this very website.<br><br>

		What makes me who I am? I, and many of my peers, would easily say that 
		it's that I can't resist a challenge. Whether it be a programming 
		competition or a Rubik's cube (Both of which I love), I strive to 
		succeed, putting in as much effort as I possibly can. I can't replicate 
		the rewarding feeling of completing a program in any other way.<br><br>

		Anyways, you're probably tired of reading by now. In the tabs above I have showcased
		some of the fun games I've worked on, and if you have questions, comments
		, suggestions, or any other things to say, feel free to contact me 
		through the link listed at the bottom of this website.<br><br>
