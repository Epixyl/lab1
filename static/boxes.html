			<p>This was a game I created way back in high school. It utilized GML, a popular and powerful game design language built in to the Gamemaker engine. 
			   It was also my first game that featured a save and load functionality. This project took around 6 months to build and refine, since I had schoolwork to do
			   at the time as well.</p>
			<p>The goal of the game is to form a working machine out of smaller parts. Boxes are inputted into the machine, each with a numerical value, and your machine needs to sort and manipulate
				them to satisfy rules such as "Accept boxes divisible by 2" or "Take the square root". The game was very popular amongst my friends, some of which were new to programming and enjoyed the easier levels,
				as well as others who enjoyed the challenge of the more difficult levels.</p>
			<p>Now, I have ported the game to Unity along with an overhaul of the game engine. Now it runs faster and has no bugs that I know of. You can even try it out for yourself by clicking the link above. </p>
